			<h2>Developments in international and European circumstances</h2><br>
			<p>This chapter summarises developments in international and European circumstances over the past year.</p>
			<p>Despite expanding capacity and falling costs for renewable energy, global emissions continued
			rising in 2018. The UK is one of several countries and regions to set a net-zero emissions target in
			the last year, but overall international commitments to reduce emissions remain insufficient. The
			coming 18 months are a vital period for increasing global effort, and the UK must lead this
			process as the expected host of the UN climate talks ('COP26') at the end of 2020.</p><hr class="chapterHR">
			<h2>Global and European greenhouse gas emissions</h2><br>
			<p>In 2018 global emissions of CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels and industrial processes rose,
			an increase of around 2% from 2017 levels. This follows a 1% increase in 2017, after very small
			increases between 2014 - 2016. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Many regions contributed to the increase in global emissions:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>China's estimated CO2 emissions grew by around 2.2% in 2018, although historical Chinese
					energy statistics are often subject to substantial revisions. This increase was driven by
					emissions from the burning of coal, supplemented with increasing oil and gas consumption.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The USA's CO2 emissions increased 2.6% in 2018, driven in part by relatively large heating
					and cooling demands of a cold winter and warm summer along with strong economic
					growth. US CO2 emissions are projected to fall in 2019 and 2020 by a leading US energy
					agency.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>India's CO2 emissions grew strongly at 7% in 2018, underpinned by strong economic growth.
					Although renewable energy deployment continues rapidly, it is being outstripped by energy
					demand growth, leading to rapidly growing coal consumption.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In the EU emissions of CO2 decreased by about 2% in 2018 relative to 2017 levels, the first fall
					since 2014.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

				<h3>Carbon intensity</h3>
				<p>The carbon intensity of energy decreased 1% in 2018 relative to 2017. This follows similar
				annual decreases since 2011, prior to which global average carbon intensity of energy had
				been essentially flat since 1990.</p>

				<h3>Energy intensity</h3>
				<p>The energy intensity of the global economy only fractionally improved in 2018, reducing
				0.1%, a significantly smaller improvement than that seen in recent years. Improved energy
				intensity has been the dominant driver of the slight decoupling between CO2 emissions and
				economic growth since 1990.</p>

				<h3>GE Growth</h3>
				<p>However, the effect of global economic growth in 2018 (3%, slightly higher than 2.8% per
				year averaged over 2013 - 2017) more than offset these improvements.</p>

			<h2>The rest of the world.</h2><br>
			<p>The Rest of the World also increased CO2 emissions in 2018 by 1.7% on 2017 levels.</p>
			<p>Global aggregated GHG emissions (using GWP100 values from the IPCC 4th Assessment Report)
			rose 1.3% in 2017 (the latest year available) to 55.1 GtCe per year when including emissions
			from land-use change.</p><hr class="chapterHR">
			<h2>Projected economic growth</h2><br>
			<p>Projected economic growth for 2019 at around 2.6% will tend to drive a continued increase in
			global CO2 and GHG emissions this year. However, with falling costs of renewable energy,
			increasing retirements of coal capacity and pledged efforts to reduce emissions, there is
			potential for the trend to be reversed..</p>
			<p>Actions in the UK to set and pursue vigorously ambitious emissions reduction targets can help
			support an increase in global effort to start reducing emissions. Already the UK is sending
			positive international signals by demonstrating that it is possible to cut emissions while growing
			the economy and to run a power system without relying on coal. Longer term, the UK can play
			an important role by developing and deploying technologies, institutions and business models
			to decarbonise harder-to-abate sectors, such as carbon capture and storage in industry, which
			can then be deployed internationally. </p><br>
