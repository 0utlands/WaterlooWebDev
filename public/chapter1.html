			<h2>Introduction to reporting progress towards carbon budgets</h2><br>
			<h3>In May 2019, in response to a request by the UK, Scottish and Welsh Governments, the
			Committee advised that now is the right time to set a net-zero target for the UK, going beyond
			the existing 2050 target for at least an 80% reduction required by the Climate Change Act (2008):</h3>
			<p>• The Committee recommended that the UK should set and vigorously pursue an ambitious
			target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) to 'net-zero' (i.e. at least a 100%
			reduction) by 2050. Reflecting their respective circumstances, Scotland should set a net-zero
			GHG target for 2045 and Wales should target a 95% reduction by 2050 relative to 1990.
			<br><br><br>
			• In June 2019, the UK Government accepted the Committee’s advice and amended the 2050
			target under the Climate Change Act to require net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by that
			date. The Government stated that emissions should reach net-zero across the whole
			economy (i.e. including international aviation and shipping) and that the aim would be to
			reach net-zero emissions without recourse to international credits (or ‘offsets’), consistent
			with the Committee’s advice.
			<br><br><br>
			• Earlier, the Scottish Government announced that the recommended net-zero target for 2045
			would be placed in legislation under the Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets)
			(Scotland) Bill that is currently passing through the Scottish Parliament. The Bill is currently at
			Stage 2 of the Scottish parliamentary process.
			<br><br><br>
			• The Welsh Government accepted the Committee’s advice to legislate for a reduction in
			greenhouse gas emissions of 95% by 2050, but stated an ambition to reach net-zero
			emissions by this date. We will work further with the Welsh Government to understand how
			net-zero emissions could be achieved in Wales.</p>
			<br><br><hr><br>
			
			
			
			<h2>Economy-wide emissions trends for the UK</h2><br>
			<p>UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fell by 2.3% in 2018 to 491 MtCO₂e and have fallen 40%
			since 1990. Over the same period, the economy has grown by 75% (Figure 1.2). Adjusting for
			differences in temperatures between 2017 and 2018, the underlying change in total emissions in
			this latest year was slightly higher, a reduction of 3.1%.
			These figures include emissions from international aviation and shipping (IAS), consistent with
			the net-zero 2050 target. UK emissions are often stated excluding IAS.
			2 This figure shows a
			higher rate of reduction (44%) since 1990, but overstates the overall progress in reducing total
			UK emissions as IAS emissions have increased by over 80% since 1990.</p>
			<p>Methodology changes to the UK emissions inventory are designed to increase the transparency,
			accuracy, consistency, comparability, and completeness of the inventory. There are three
			primary sources of uncertainty in the UK inventory:
			<br><br><br>
			• Uncertainty in the current GHG inventory. This comprises the statistical uncertainty in
			emission factors and activity data used in estimating emissions. It is internal to the inventory,
			is well quantified and it is possible to formally assess the probability of errors through
			methods set out in IPCC guidelines. For the 2014 inventory, the uncertainty was estimated as
			±3% with 95% confidence. This uncertainty was concentrated in sectors involving complex
			biological processes or diffuse sources such as waste, agriculture and land use, land-use
			change and forestry (LULUCF).
			
			<br><br><br>
			• Uncertainty in Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) assigned to GHGs. GWPs are used to
			convert emissions from different gases into a single comparable metric (tonnes of CO2-
			equivalent, or tCO2e). There have been multiple changes to the GWP estimates used for
			methane, N₂O and F-gases since the inception of the inventory. Future changes to GWPs will
			significantly affect emissions as measured in MtCO₂e.
			• Uncertainty from other activities. Some sources of emissions and activities (e.g. peatlands)
			are not currently included in the inventory but will be included in the future, thus adding to
			overall GHG estimates.
			<br><br><br>
			• Changes between inventories published in 2018 and 2019 increased the estimate of emissions in
			2016 - the most recent comparable year - by around 5 MtCO₂e (0.6% of 1990 emissions). There
			are two known changes to future emissions inventories that could add over 40 MtCO₂e per year
			to the inventory before 2025 (Box 1.1). Our recommendation for a net-zero greenhouse gas
			target in 2050 takes these two methodological changes into account, and we will provide
			further advice in due course on how these changes should be managed for existing carbon
			budgets.

			<h2>Sector-by-sector emissions trends for the UK</h2><br>
			<h3>In 2018 for the fifth consecutive year, the sector with the largest percentage reduction in
			emissions was the power sector (Figure 1.4). Excluding the power sector, economy-wide
			progress was much less positive, with emissions falling by 1.0% on average (2.0% when
			temperature-adjusted). Reaching net-zero emissions in 2050 will require an average annual
			emissions reduction of around 15 MtCO2e (equivalent to 3% of 2018 emissions) across the
			economy</h3>
			<p>
			• Surface transport. Surface transport is the largest-emitting sector in the UK, accounting for
			23% of UK emissions. Following three consecutive years of growth between 2014 and 2016,
			emissions were stable in 2017 and fell by 2% in 2018 to 115 MtCO₂e. Emissions from all major
			modes of transport decreased in 2018, with the largest reduction of 0.9 MtCO2e (-1.3%)7 from
			cars.
			<br><br><br>
			Demand for car travel increased slightly, albeit at a significantly lower rate than previous
			years, which was more than offset by a combination of improved fleet fuel efficiency and
			increased use of biofuels.
			From 2009 to 2016, the average CO₂ emitted per km from new cars fell, leading to an
			improvement in overall car efficiency across the fleet. However, this trend has reversed in the
			last two years, with the average new car sold in 2018 and 2017 being less carbon-efficient
			than the previous year.
			<br><br><br>
			• Industry. Direct GHG emissions from industry, covering both traded and non-traded
			emissions (i.e. inside and outside the EU ETS), fell by 1% to 104 MtCO₂e in 2018. Emissions
			were 52% below 1990 levels and accounted for 21% of all UK emissions. Manufacturing8
			contributed to 61% of direct industrial GHG emissions, and petroleum refining, fossil fuel
			production and fugitive emissions made up 39%. In addition to these direct emissions,
			industry consumed almost a third of UK grid electricity, implying indirect emissions of
			around 20 MtCO₂e.
			<br><br><br>
			• Buildings. Actual emissions from buildings increased by 3% to 88 MtCO₂e in 2018. When
			emissions are adjusted for lower winter temperatures, in particular the extreme cold weather
			in February 2018, the underlying change was a 1% fall in emissions. On a temperatureadjusted basis, residential emissions fell by 2% whilst non-residential emissions increased by
			1%. This small overall fall follows two consecutive increases in temperature-adjusted
			emissions in 2016 and 2017. Buildings emissions in 2018 remained higher than 2015 levels
			on both an actual and temperature-adjusted basis.
			<br><br><br>
			• Power sector. Emissions fell by 10% in 2018 to 65 MtCO₂ and are now 68% below 1990
			levels, reflecting a 9% decrease in emissions intensity since 2017 to 242 gCO2/kWh. Lowcarbon generation in 2018 accounted for a record high of 54% of total UK generation
			(160 TWh). Specifically, renewable generation increased by 12% to 101 TWh in 2018. The
			share of coal generation decreased from 33% (114 TWh) in 2008 to 5% (16 TWh) in 2018.
			Electricity consumption increased slightly (1%) in 2018, against a long-term trend of a 12%
			fall since 2008. Despite sustained progress in the power sector, emissions reductions are
			slowing down compared to average annual reductions of 14% since 2012, reflecting
			diminishing potential to reduce emissions further by phasing out coal generation.
			Emissions data for international transport and for sectors with large shares of non-CO2
			greenhouse gas emissions are produced with a one-year lag, so emissions in the following
			sectors are only available up to 2017:
			<br><br><br>
			• Aviation. Total aviation emissions increased by 3.5% to 36.5 MtCO₂e from 2016 to 2017, the
			latest year for which data is available. Within this, emissions from international flights
			increased by 3.6% to 35.0 Mt and emissions from domestic flights by 2.6% to 1.5 Mt. Overall,
			emissions from aviation in 2017 were more than double 1990 levels.
			• Shipping. Total shipping emissions fell by 5.7% to 13.8 MtCO2e from 2016 to 2017, the latest
			year for which data is available. Emissions from international journeys fell by 8.6% to 7.8 Mt
			and emissions from domestic journeys by 1.7% to 5.9 Mt. Overall, emissions from shipping in
			2017 were 17% lower than 1990 levels.
			<br><br><br>
			• Agriculture. Emissions from agriculture increased by 1% from 2016 to 2017 to 45.6 MtCO₂e
			(9% of all UK emissions). Emissions from agriculture were 16% below 1990 levels, but there
			has been no progress in reducing emissions from agriculture since 2008. Methane accounted
			for 56% of emissions from agriculture in 2017, and almost half (47%) of total agriculture
			emissions were from the digestive process of livestock.
			Emissions from managing agricultural soils, largely resulting from nitrogen fertiliser use,
			accounted for 25% of the sector’s emissions, with the remainder from waste management
			and on-farm energy use.
			<br><br><br>
			• Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). The sector is a net carbon sink and on
			the basis of the latest inventory this increased by 1% to -9.9 MtCO₂e in 2017. The estimated
			size of the LULUCF sink is around 5 MtCO₂e smaller compared to last year’s GHG inventory
			due mainly to a correction for the double counting of forestry deadwood. The inclusion of
			emissions from peatland in future inventories is expected to make the LULUCF sector a net
			source of emissions.
			<br><br><br>
			• Waste. Total emissions from waste increased by 1% to 20.4 MtCO₂e in 2017, and were 69%
			below 1990 levels. Almost 70% of emissions from waste were methane from the anaerobic
			decomposition of biodegradable waste in landfill sites.
			<br><br><br>
			• F-gases. F-gas emissions fell by 6% from 2016 to 2017 to 15.0 MtCO₂e. This is largely due to
			the EU-wide cap on the use of F-gases, particularly in refrigeration and air conditioning units.
			</p><br><br><hr><br>
			<h2>Consumption-based accounting - the UK's carbon footprint</h2><br>
			<h3>Emissions covered by the carbon budgets and the 2050 target are those released by activities
			occurring within the UK's borders only. This accounting approach is known as the 'territorial'
			basis.</h3>
			<br><br><br>
			<p>• It is the standard accounting approach for measuring emissions internationally, as required
			by the UNFCCC when countries compile their annual emissions inventories.9
			<br><br><br>
			• It avoids the risks that either some emissions are missed or the same block of emissions are
			counted by more than one country and hence would be double-counted when aggregated
			to a global level.
			<br><br><br>
			• It also maps most closely to the levers available to the UK to reduce emissions.</p><br><br><br>
			<h3>Emissions can also be measured on a 'consumption' basis for which the allocation by country is
			based on where goods and services (which lead to emissions during their production) are
			eventually consumed. This is also known as the 'carbon footprint' of a country.
			Defra release an annual publication on the level of the UK's consumption-based emissions,
			which are more uncertain than territorial-based emissions.</h3>
			<br><br><br>
			<p>
			• The statistics are classified as "experimental" due to inherent uncertainties. They are also
			produced with a longer lag (the latest year is 2016) given the detailed modelling of global
			supply chains which is required.
			<br><br><br>
			• While the amount of goods consumed in the UK is well known from official Government
			statistics on imports and exports, the total emissions associated with producing UK imports
			is much harder to determine: it depends on estimates of how commodities are produced in
			all of the countries that the UK imports from, either directly or via intermediaries, and the
			emissions associated with each part of those supply chains.
