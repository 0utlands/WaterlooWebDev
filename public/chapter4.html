			<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
			<p>After the end of a carbon budget the Committee is required to assess how the budget was or
was not met, and the actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the budget period.
The second carbon budget finished in 2017 and final data are now available. This Progress
Report therefore assesses performance over that budget.</p>
<h2>Overall Impression</h2><br>
			<p>Overall, our assessment is that although the second carbon budget was met, this was primarily
due to accounting changes in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and the impact of the
financial crisis, and not due to policy. Had the EU ETS cap and economic conditions been in line
with original expectations, the budget would have been missed by more than 2%. </p>
<p>This chapter sets out this assessment. It includes an analysis of key factors driving changes in
emissions over the second carbon budget period. It is organised in three sections:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The net carbon account for the second carbon budget</li>
	<li>The impact of policies on emissions reduction over the second carbon budget</li>
	<li>. Assessment of non-policy factors underpinning the second carbon budget surplus</li>
</ol>

				<h3>Carbon Budget</h3>
				<p>The second carbon budget was legislated at 2,782 MtCO2e, which set the maximum level of the
net carbon account for the UK over the period 2013-2017.

				<h3>Net Carbon</h3>
				<p>The net carbon account is defined as the level of UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, excluding
emissions from international aviation and shipping, and net of any trading of emissions
allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) (see Chapter 1, Box 1.2)</p>

advice of the Committee before making a decision</p>

			<h2>Meeting the Carbon Budget</h2><br>
			<p>Overall our policy indicators for 2017, the last year of the second carbon budget, suggest there
was limited progress in most areas outside of the EU ETS (Table 4.2):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Transport. None of our high-level indicators were met. New car emissions, registrations of
electric vehicles, uptake of biofuels, and distances travelled were all behind schedule.</li>
				<li>Industry. Our overarching indicator for the sector (i.e. direct combustion CO2 emissions) has
been met. This largely reflects growth in the manufacturing sector being significantly lower
than expected in 2008 when the budget was set (see Section 1.3), as well as other factors
such as plant closures, improvements in energy intensity and changes in the fuel mix.</li>
				<li>Buildings. Most of our high-level indicators have not been met. Insulation rates fell very
significantly after installation programmes (i.e. Carbon Emissions Reduction Target, CERT and
Community Energy Saving Programme, CESP) ended in 2012, with the replacement
obligation (ECO) less ambitious than its predecessors and the Green Deal failing to deliver.
Whilst low-carbon heating appears to exceed the indicator, much of this is either bioenergy
in the form of domestic biomass (which is not the long-term best use of finite bioenergy
resources) or reversible air-to-air heat pumps in commercial buildings (generally installed for
cooling). Residential heat pump sales remained below the levels needed.</li>
				<li>Power. Both our indicators for grid emissions intensity and total renewable generation have
been met, reflecting the progress made in decarbonising electricity generation.</li>
				<li>Agriculture, land use and forestry. None of our indicators were met, reflecting the lack of
firm government policy in this area.</li>
				<li>Waste. Good progress was made reducing waste emissions.</li>
				<li>F-gases. Our F-gas emissions indicator was not met. The main policy instrument, the EU Fgas Regulation, only came into effect in 2015.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr class = "chapterHR">
			<p>Overall, we conclude that UK policies did not deliver ahead of schedule in the second carbon
budget period. Progress was mostly confined to sectors covered by the EU ETS. In particular,
policies have contributed significantly to reducing emissions in the power sector. </p>

			<h3>Fossil Fuel Usee has Dropped</h3>
			<p>The share of electricity generated from fossil fuels fell from 64% to 48% between 2013
and 2017 as renewable generation expanded from 16% to 30% of total generation,
largely as a result of policies including Contracts for Difference (CfD) and Feed-in Tariffs
(FiT).</p>

			<h3>LArge Progress in the Offshore Wind Sector</h3>
			<p>Progress was most significant for offshore wind, where auction prices went from over
£145/MWh to under £65/MWh between 2013 and 2017 (for projects commissioning
between 2020 and 2025 respectively, see Figure 4.2.a).64 Levelised costs of onshore wind
decreased by a third while solar levelised costs almost halved between 2013 and 2016
alone.

power plant since 1995, show the emphasis the UK has put on electrification and lowcarbon power generation. </p>
