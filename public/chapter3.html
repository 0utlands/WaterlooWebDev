			<h2>Chapter 3: Underlying progress in the UK
			towards deep emissions reduction </h2>
			<p>This chapter is about what the UK is currently doing to reduce emissions and contains information on each industry in relation to reduction of emissions.</p>
			<p>Future emissions reductions depend on policies and actions taken now. In this chapter we
			review progress against our indicators for measures to reduce emissions and implementation of
			policies to drive future reductions.
			</p>

			<p>We consider progress towards future carbon budgets and deep decarbonisation by 2050, in
			three sections:<br><br>
			1. Actions to reduce emissions<br>
			2. Progress in policy development<br>
			3. The net-zero challenge – what is needed from policy now<br>
			</p>
			<hr class="chapterHR">
			<h2>1. Actions to reduce emissions</h2>
			<p>We track progress towards meeting carbon budgets and the 2050 target through the use of
			indicators, which both help to explain progress to date in reducing emissions and provide a
			guide to likely future reductions</p>
			<p>Progress is generally off-track in most sectors, with only seven out of 24 of the indicators on track
			in 2018 (Table 3.1). Outside the power and industry sectors, only two indicators were on track: </p><br>
			
			<ul>
			<li>Progress in deploying measures to reduce emissions is off-track across transport, buildings,
			agriculture and land use. In these areas, progress to date is behind virtually every indicator
			we track, often by a wide margin</li>
			<li>There has been good progress in the power sector, driven by strong policy. Policy has
			incentivised renewable power generation and driven down costs in doing so, pushed coal to
			the margins of the electricity system through carbon pricing, and reduced demand through
			efficiency improvements mostly driven by regulation and product standards. Although
			isolated, this represents a significant success and is clear evidence that emissions can be
			driven down by a well-designed, comprehensive policy package.</li>
			<li>At a high level, progress in industry has been good, but it is important to look beneath this to
			understand whether progress is due to action to decarbonise or wider shifts in technology
			and the economy. Our decomposition analysis, which seeks to attribute changes to different
			drivers of emissions, suggests that over the period 2012-2017 industrial output grew 14%,
			and that the 12% fall in direct CO₂ emissions can be attributed to a structural movement
			towards a less carbon-intensive mix of industrial output (accounting for 20% of the change),
			improvements in energy intensity (40%) and changes in fuel mix (40%). It is not clear
			whether these reductions were driven by policy.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>We plan to update our indicator set once we have assessed the pathway towards net-zero
			emissions by 2050 as part of advising on the sixth carbon budget. This is likely to entail both
			reassessment of the level of indicators to reflect the need for more rapid deployment (e.g. of
			electric vehicles) and a broadening of the indicator set (e.g. on the demand side). </p>

			<h2>2. Progress in policy development</h2><br>
			<p>Our previous progress reports have set out the ‘policy gap’ to meeting the fourth and fifth
			carbon budgets, both of which were set on the cost-effective path to achieving an 80%
			reduction in emissions by 2050. These budgets will need to be outperformed on the way to
			achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
			Over the last year, Government estimates of the policy gap to the fourth and fifth carbon
			budgets have gone up due to increases in their projections of ‘baseline’ emissions (i.e. before
			policy) outweighing additional savings due to new policies.</p>

				<h3>Transport</h3>
				<p>The carbon intensity of energy decreased 1% in 2018 relative to 2017. This follows similar
				annual decreases since 2011, prior to which global average carbon intensity of energy had
				been essentially flat since 1990.</p>

				<p>There has been a surge in policy activity for industrial decarbonisation in the past year, including
				the setting of the Government’s industrial decarbonisation clusters mission, which aims to
				establish the world’s first net-zero carbon industrial cluster by 2040 and at least one low-carbon
				cluster by 2030. Despite this activity, proposals and ambitions need to be turned into clear and
				concrete policies and further ambition is required. </p>

				<p>All of the key buildings policy gaps identified in our 2018 progress report remain unaddressed or
				only partially met. It remains unclear how the Government will deliver its target for all houses to
				be made EPC band C by 2035. In contrast, Scotland provides a good example of setting
				trajectories across the existing building stock (Box 3.2). In other areas there has been progress,
				but it falls short of what is needed</p>

			<h2>3. The net-zero challenge – what is needed from policy now</h2>
			<p>Reaching net-zero GHG emissions requires extensive changes across the economy,
			with complete switchovers of several parts of the UK capital stock to low-carbon technologies
			and development of new industries for carbon capture and storage and low-carbon hydrogen
			production. Major infrastructure decisions need to be made in the near future and quickly
			implemented. The public will need to be engaged in making the required changes.</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li>Delivery must progress with far greater urgency. Many current plans are insufficiently
			ambitious; others are proceeding too slowly, even for the current 80% target</li>
			<li>Challenges that have not yet been confronted must now be addressed by Government.
			Industry and heat must be largely decarbonised, heavy goods vehicles must also switch to
			low-carbon fuels, emissions from international aviation and shipping cannot be ignored, and
			a fifth of our agricultural land must shift to alternative uses that support emissions reduction</li>
			<li>Clear leadership is needed, right across Government, with delivery in partnership with
			businesses and communities</li>
			<li>Clear leadership is needed, right across Government, with delivery in partnership with
			businesses and communities</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>To be an effective host of the UN talks and an influential climate leader, the UK Government
			must now back its net-zero emissions target with a coherent national policy package to deliver
			it. The key elements should be developed over the next 12-18 months, ahead of the UN talks.
